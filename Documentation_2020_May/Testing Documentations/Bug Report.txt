Some Common and Time consuming Errors we founded and Resolved during development:-

Import errors:-

- RCTScrollContentView (at ScrollView.js:1038)
- RCTScrollView (at ScrollView.js:1178)
- ScrollView (at App.js:25)
- RCTSafeAreaView (at SafeAreaView.js:55)
- SafeAreaView (at App.js:24)
- App (at renderApplication.js:40)
- RCTView (at AppContainer.js:101)
- RCTView (at AppContainer.js:119)
- AppContainer (at renderApplication.js:39)

Animated.View error:-

- RCTView (at file.js:27)
- FadeInView (at file.js:42)
- RCTView (at file.js:41)
- _default (at App.js:29)
- RCTScrollContentView (at ScrollView.js:1038)
- RCTScrollView (at ScrollView.js:1178)
- SafeAreaView (at App.js:24)
- App (at renderApplication.js:40)
- RCTView (at AppContainer.js:101)
- RCTView (at AppContainer.js:119)
- AppContainer (at renderApplication.js:39)


Dependencies error Error:- 
- undefined Unable to resolve module
- /node_modules/react-native-root-siblings/lib/AppRegistryInjection.js: Module does not   exist in the module map
- error: method does not override or implement a method from a supertype


Unexpected App crash on launch problem:-
- missing android SDK problems everytie we merge and pull from Github.


Returning Invalid React Component Error:-
- warning.js:36 Warning: React.createElement: type should not be null, undefined, boolean, or number. It should be a string (for DOM elements) or a ReactClass (for composite components). Check the render method of `App`.


Canâ€™t Render Object Error:-
- Objects are not valid as a React child

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolved above Errors by following commands and good coding practises:-

- cd android and gradlew clean for Troubleshooting Android.

- Uninstall the App from emulator or Device and start again.

- npm install in main folder and npm install in android folder.

- To avoid some import errors:- when creating and exporting components, we learned not to   mix default and named imports (Saves lot of time)

- Install latest Android SDK packages

- Sometimes we need to run the server seperatly using: react-native start

- Avoided Animated.View error by creating an element like this: <Animated.View>

- Clear watchman watches by: watchman watch-del-all

- Delete node_modules: rm -rf node_modules 

- Remove the cache: rm -rf /tmp/metro-*

- Use Property destructuring

- Split render elements into readable helper function()

- Use the meaningful name for variables

- Define proptypes

- Separate lifecycle, methods and render Elements in the component
